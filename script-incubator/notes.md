To hold and incubate scripts found to give blocking errors.

To Do
 Diagnose broken scripts with potential remedies. ie hubot applies remedy and attempts loading the script again.
  Any of Hubot's iterations will be re-named copies of the incubated script concatenating the version of the script and it's status of incubation.
 If Hubot cannot get the script running by itself it will create a github issue where it reports the issue and saves the issue # to the scripts header meta.
